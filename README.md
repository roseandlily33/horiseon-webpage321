## Challenge
The challenge was to refractor some HTML and CSS code to make it meet certain criteria such as <im> tags with alt="", and have a semantic HTML.

## Difficulties
I had an awful hard time trying to get it uploaded to git, it would have had more commit's but unfortuntaly that is not how it worked out.
