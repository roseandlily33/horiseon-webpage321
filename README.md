# horiseon-webpage321
Week 1 Challenge

## Usage - What you can do:
The links on the top correspond to the sections underneath the picture, when clicked the webpage will jump down to the desired section.

## Link to URL
https://roseandlily33.github.io/horiseon-webpage321/

## Challenge
The challenge was to refractor some HTML and CSS code to make it meet certain criteria such as <im> tags with alt="", and have a semantic HTML.

## Difficulties & Learning
- The background-img: url(") was not coming up for me no matter what I tried, so I moved it to the HTML document and did some formatting to make it work.

- I also had a very hard time uploading it to gitHub, but I learned so much. I tried to add as many commit's as I could once I had gotten it up.

- I learned how to fork a repository, more about how to use gitHub.
In HTML I learned how to link to a part of the page as well as what is necessary and what is not. I learned what would make the most sense when it comes to selecting semantic elements and how to select pictures out of folders, and ways to work around something if it is not working. 

- In CSS I got a better understanding of how to select elements that you want to select, and that there is multiple ways to fix or do something.
