Week 1 Challenge

## Challenge
The challenge was to refractor some HTML and CSS code to make it meet certain criteria such as <im> tags with alt="", and have a semantic HTML.

## Difficulties
The background-img: url(") was not coming up for me no matter what I tried, so I moved it to the HTML document and did some formatting to make it work.
I also had a very hard time uploading it to gitHub, but I learned so much. I tried to add as many commit's as I could once I had gotten it up.
